## Temaki

An expansion pack for [Maki](https://github.com/mapbox/maki)


### What is it?

The [Maki](https://github.com/mapbox/maki) icon pack is pretty great!  I use it in the [iD editor](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD) project, but sometimes:

* I need an icon that's out of scope for Maki
* I don't want to wait for an icon to be added to Maki
* I'm ok with not having 11px versions

So in these situations, I'll just draw something "good enough" and put it here.

The Temaki icons are a little bigger and messier than the Maki ones, but just as delicious. :yum:


### Design guidelines

I try to mostly follow the excellent [Maki design guidelines](https://www.mapbox.com/maki-icons/guidelines/) but these icons are only available in 15px versions.


### Contributing

Icon requests are very welcome!  This project is only for icons that aren't already in [Maki](https://github.com/mapbox/maki).
